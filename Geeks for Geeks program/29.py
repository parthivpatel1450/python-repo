"""
Given an array arr[], find the first repeating element. The element should occur more than once and the index of its first occurrence should be the smallest.

Note:- The position you return should be according to 1-based indexing. 

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 appears twice and its first appearance is at index 2 which is less than 3 whose first the occurring index is 3.

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: -1
Explanation: All elements appear only once so answer is -1.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
