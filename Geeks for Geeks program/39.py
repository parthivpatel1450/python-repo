There are  bags with diamonds in them. The i'th of these bags contains arr[i] diamonds. If you drop a bag with arr[i] diamonds, it changes to arr[i]/2 diamonds and you gain arr[i] diamonds. Dropping a bag takes 1 minute. Find the maximum number of diamonds that you can take if you are given k minutes.

Examples:

Input:arr[]= [2, 1, 7, 4, 2], k = 3
Output: 14
Explanation:
The state of bags is:2 1 7 4 2
Take all diamonds from Third bag (7).
State of bags becomes: 2 1 3 4 2 
Take all diamonds from Fourth bag (4).
State of bags becomes: 2 1 3 2 2
Take all diamonds from Third bag (3).
State of bags becomes: 2 1 1 2 2 
Hence,number of Diamonds = 7+4+3 = 14.
Input:arr[]=[7, 1, 2], k = 2
Output:10
Explanation:
Take all diamonds from First bag (7).
State of bags becomes: 3 1 2 
Take all diamonds from again First bag (3).
State of bags becomes: 1 1 2
You can take a maximum of 10 diamonds.
Constraints:
1 ≤ n≤ 105
